Course project for the Data Science course on Getting and Cleaning Data

# Description
Overall description

# Procedure
Steps taken to generate tidy_data.txt

# Files
* CodeBook.md - file describing the variables in the final data set, tidy_data.txt
* run_analysis.R - R script to load up all the raw data, process it, and generate the tidy data
* tidy_data.txt - the tidy data after being processed through run_analysis.R. See CodeBook.md for information on the variables and units in tidy_data.txt
* gen_codebook.R - R script to dynamically generate the codebook based on instructions in the features_info.txt file

# Requirements
